# Potential Customer Recognition

<p><b>Scenario:</b> You are working for Company X as a Data Scientist. Company X has been commissioned by an insurance company to develop a tool to optimize their marketing efforts. Your objective is to determine which set of customers the marketing firm should contact to maximize profit.</p>

<p>• The cost of marketing to a particular customer is $30. This cost is paid regardless of whether the customer responds to our marketing or not.</p>

<p>• Only if a customer responds to our marketing, do we earn a profit.<p/>
     
<p>• Profit does NOT include the marketing cost.</p>
<p>• Total Profit = Average profit per responding Customer * Number of customers responding –
Number of customers to whom you marketed * $30 </p>
<p>• Y variable = responded (i.e., column V in “training.candidate.xlxs”)</p>
<p>• X variables = everything else</p>
<p>• Profit variable is in column “W” of the “training.candidate.xlxs” and not in the testing data</p>

<p><b>Data:</b> The insurance company has provided you with a historical data set (training.candidate.xlxs). The company has also provided you with a list of potential customers to whom to market (testingCandidate.xlxs). From this list of potential customers, you need to determine yes/no whether you wish to market to them.</p>
